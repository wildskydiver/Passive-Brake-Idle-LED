# Passive-Brake-Idle-LED
Using Arduino - Program runs LEDs Brightness, Forward and Backward indicator lights that use the gravity force from a MPU06050. 
This is a new project that would love the attention or help of others.
Currently the MPU6050 commands the LEDS over one signal wire. Power is ran from the  Arduino under a 500mah limit (limit is on the ardunio) 
SETTING A BRIGHTNESS TO HIGH WILL DAMAGE YOUR LEDS AND BURN YOUR ARDUINO OR LEDS.
